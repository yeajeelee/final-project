      <h2>About Coffee</h2>
      <p>According to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi was the first person who discovered coffee beans and their benefits. Kaldi noticed that after his goats ate the cherries of a particular tree in the ancient coffee forests of the Ethiopian plateau, they were so full of energy that they didn’t want to sleep at night.</p>
      <p>There are many different ways to drink and make coffee. Below are a few popular types and what makes each one unique.</p>

      <h2>Espresso</h2>
      <p>Espresso is an intricate way to brew a highly concentrated coffee by using high pressure and finely ground coffee. This process creates a strong, syrupy shot with a layer of foam called crema on top.</p>

      <h2>Latte</h2>
      <p>“Latte” in Italian means milk. A latte is milk and espresso combined together. It is known for its creaminess and a less strong espresso taste.</p>

      <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
      <p>Cold brew is made by steeping coffee grounds in water for several days in the fridge. This creates a smooth, less acidic concentrate with a stronger taste and higher caffeine content.</p>
      <p><em>I personally like it with a flavored cold foam on top!</em></p>

      <h2>Drip Coffee</h2>
      <p>Drip coffee is a very standard coffee that is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, allowing it to brew while seeping through a filter. You typically use a coffee machine, a filter, and water for this method.</p>

      <h2>Shaken Espresso</h2>
      <p>A shaken espresso is made by vigorously shaking espresso with ice. This chills the espresso quickly, dilutes it just enough to reduce bitterness, and aerates it to create a light, foamy top layer.</p>
      <p>It can be finished with a splash of milk for a smooth, balanced taste.</p>
